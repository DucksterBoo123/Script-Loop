In any case please do not use this script if you comply with the following:  - Unaware of the built-in process manager : Task Manager - Unaware of how to open .vbs files in a text editor - Unaware of the legal consequences of causing harm to a computer without the owner's consent - Unaware that this is not designed for attacking or griefing somebody's computer - Unaware of basic and advanced computer operation  EXPLANATION OF SCRIPT:  The script opens up a dialogue box showing the path of the script and two options, "Ok" and the Cross in the top right corner. They both open another diaglogue box when clicked. This new dialogue box says "IT'S A TRAP", has the title "YOU CAN NEVER ESCAPE THE lOOP" and also has the three options "Retry", "Cancel" and the Cross in the top right corner. All three leads to that specific box closing however the original box remains open. Hence, the only way to close the original box is from task manager which cuts off the application without interacting with the application. (Closing the application from the taskbar will just do the same thing as the application's buttons)
